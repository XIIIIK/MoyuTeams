# Moyu .exe / app for Teams

**Update 20211003** <br/>
This is a small .exe / app to help you cope with the auto leave function of Teams. <br/>
When the program is processing, your mouse will automatically move in a circle on your screen. Therefore, the Teams will regard you are present and will keep your status as online. <br/>
This version is a prototype of the fundimental function of the .exe/app. In the maybe upcoming version, some UI work will be add and authorize you to control the movement pattern of the mouse or the way to exit the app.
